# dist

This folder contains the build output generated automatically. **Do not edit files here manually.**

## Usage

- **Main interface entry:** `/hash/` (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/hash/](http://localhost:8080/hash/))
- The root URL ([http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)) receives a hash value and generates the artwork in `index.html`.
- The hash in the URL encodes the drawing data and parameters, allowing you to share or reproduce a specific work.

This folder is for deployment or static hosting. All files are generated by the build process. If you want to modify the source code, please edit files in the project root or `src/` directory and rebuild.
